# Example for LRZ cluster

### Notes:
1) must create environment via conda, as python 3.9.10 is not installed on the lrz cluster; 
conda create --name myenv python=3.9.10
2) this repo doesn't contain any cpp code;
3) this repo doens't automate the creation of run_list.csv, job_name and other useful perks;
